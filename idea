# Sentiment Analysis API - Project Idea

## 💡 Concept
A simple, fast, and production-ready sentiment analysis API that scores text from 1 (negative) to 10 (positive).

## 🎯 Goal
Build a lightweight microservice that can be:
- Deployed to AWS App Runner in minutes
- Integrated into any application via REST API
- Scaled automatically based on traffic
- Monitored and maintained easily

## 🔑 Key Features
1. **Simple Input/Output**: Send text, get sentiment score
2. **Fast**: Average response time < 100ms
3. **Scalable**: Auto-scales from 0 to 100+ instances
4. **Tested**: Full unit test coverage
5. **Production-Ready**: Health checks, error handling, logging

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **FastAPI**: Modern Python web framework
- **TextBlob**: Simple NLP library
- **Uvicorn**: Lightning-fast ASGI server
- **AWS App Runner**: Serverless container platform

## 📊 Use Cases
- Social media monitoring
- Customer feedback analysis
- Product review scoring
- Support ticket prioritization
- Content moderation
- Market sentiment tracking

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy
1. **Development**: Local testing with Python
2. **Testing**: Automated unit tests with pytest
3. **Staging**: Deploy to App Runner dev environment
4. **Production**: Auto-deploy from GitHub main branch

## 💰 Cost Estimate
- **Development**: Free (local)
- **Production** (low traffic): ~$20-30/month
- **Production** (medium traffic): ~$50-100/month
- Scales automatically with usage

## 📈 Future Enhancements
- Multi-language support
- Emotion detection (joy, anger, fear, etc.)
- Batch processing endpoint
- Historical analysis storage
- Machine learning model integration
- WebSocket support for real-time
- Custom model training API

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes
- FastAPI application development
- RESTful API design
- AWS App Runner deployment
- Container orchestration
- CI/CD automation
- Production monitoring
- API testing strategies

## ✅ Success Metrics
- Response time < 100ms
- 99.9% uptime
- Error rate < 0.1%
- Successful auto-scaling
- Easy deployment process
- Clear documentation
